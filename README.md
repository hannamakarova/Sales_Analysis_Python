# Sales_Analysis_Python
The dataset contains information about the sales of a company operating in the global market, selling products in both physical stores and online. 

Description: Python Sales Analysis Project
This Colab notebook analyzes sales data from a global company operating in physical stores and online. It integrates three datasets:

events.csv - Sales transaction data.
products.csv - Product categories and their codes.
countries.csv - Country and region information.
The objective is to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extract valuable insights to inform decision-making. Key steps include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, renaming columns, and removing duplicates.
Data Integration: Merging datasets to form a consolidated view.
Data Analysis: Investigating sales trends, profitability, product popularity, and geographic distribution of sales.
Visualization: Creating plots to identify patterns, such as revenue by category, regional performance, and the effect of shipping intervals on profit.
Key Metrics and Findings:
Total Orders: 1,246
Total Profit: $473,709,035
High-profit regions: Europe (dominates sales).
Online channels excel in categories like Clothes and Cosmetics.
Faster delivery correlates with higher profits in many categories.
Features:
Python-based data analysis using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Profitability analysis by sales channels, product categories, and regions.
Visualization of the relationship between delivery times and profitability.
Insights into weekly and seasonal sales trends.
